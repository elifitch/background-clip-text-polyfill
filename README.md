#background-clip-text: polyfill
A simple, fire and forget polyfill that, gives a clip text effect on browsers that don't support -webkit-background-clip: text.  The polyfill builds an SVG that mimics the look of background-clip-text.  All you need to feed the polyfill is a target element, it takes care of the rest.
